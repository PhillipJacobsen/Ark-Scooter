# Functional Requirements 
Create a Scooter rental solution utilizing a mobile app and an associated Ark custom bridgechain to manage locking, unlocking, deposits, locations, and management of ARK Scooter rentals.

## Components

### Mobile App
The core user interface of the project will be a mobile app for both iOS and Android. This mobile app will manage the following:
- Customer Onboarding
- Booking
- Real-time GPS tracking of available scooters using Google Maps
- QR code / ID scanner integration
- Lock and unlock an IoT physical device (lock) to manage the security of the scooters
- In-app payments in ARK (Ñ¦)
- Show and track drop-off locations once a scooter has been rented
- Manage and track time and distance of rental (from pick-up to drop-off)
- Process deposit and fees on drop-off at a designated location
- Make the scooter available for rental after proper drop-off is completed

Optional Upgrades:
- Support multiple types of the rental by allowing the owner to take a picture of an object and upload it to the app with a category and price of their choosing
- Allow additional currencies and payment methods
- Allow a web interface for managing rentals
- Loyality Program
- Publish data according to General Bikeshare Feed Specification(GBFS)
- Rider Identification Verification
- Social media integration

### Custom ARK Bridgechain
All information related to the rental will be stored on the blockchain. This will be accomplished through several potentially new custom transaction types as follows:
- Device Registration Transaction (to register a new lock or device)
- Location Registration Transaction (pick-up/drop-off GPS coordinates)
- Rental Pick-up Transaction
- Rental Drop-off Transaction

### Provided by the ARK.io Team:
- The custom mobile app UI design
- Additional guidance and support as necessary

### Requirements for completion:
- Provide a completed mobile application that meets the above minimum criteria.
- Provide a functioning ARK based blockchain with the above custom transactions and functionality
- Demonstrate the application working as described
- Provide a Bill of Materials (BOM) for the required IoT hardware.

# Technical Specification




## Main Blocks 
Quick List(not in any particular order)
- Bridge Chain Node Management
- Custom Transaction Core Plugin(s)
- Custom Ark Logic Core Plugin
- Logic Platforms(cloud) - example: NodeRed, MQTT
- Analytics Platform(cloud) - example: thingsboard, NodeRed
- Admin App - might be included in Logic/Analytics platform
- Client App(s)(web, Android, IOS)
- IOT Hardware
- IOT Firmware
- IOT device simulator/emulator
- Test




## Bridge Chain Requirements
- Core V2.6 Testnet
- Number of forging nodes?
- Not sure if deployer will be updated to support V2.6 when we are ready for it so this might take a bit more work than the standard push button blockchain flow


## Logic platform
I am still thinking about how much of the logic should be implemented in the core plugin and how much in a cloud IOT service. Using a common/simple IOT tool such as Node Red for much of the logic would be a good approach for a POC. It is a very accesible tool to a wide range of people. It is a great tool for rapid prototyping. 

## Admin App
Requirements
- View device status
- Configure Devices
- View usage stats
- Create/View various reports
- Generate Alerts


## Potential IOT Platforms that we could use for dashboards, communication, logic

### MQTT
- Publish / Subscribe low complexity communication protocol
- Mosquito Broker is open source and requires low end VPS or Raspberry Pi
- Low cost cloud service also available to minimize setup time [CloudMQTT](https://www.cloudmqtt.com/)
- MQTT Clients
    - MQTT Box - good client for PC / chrome extension
    - MQTT Explorer - Awesome tool for exploring all the available topics on Broker
    - Many MQTT Android / iOS apps are available

### Node-Red
- Open source browser-based programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services
- Runs on Raspberry Pi.
- IBM Cloud has free tier with 250MB storage

### Thingsboard
- Device management, data collection, processing and visualization for your IoT solution
- Open Source. 
- Runs on Raspberry Pi
- Runs on Digital Ocean VPS
- Free service probably does what we need. Paid license also avaialble
